This repository is meant for analysis of a broken .docx file.

The file is generated by Aspose.NET via a Dynamics365 F&O implementation of Aareon, Tobias365

The commits show there are hardly any differences:
1x: output of 1 page
2x: output of 2 pages
3x: output of 3 pages
4x: output of 4 pages

The file gets corrupted at 4x. Unclear why.
